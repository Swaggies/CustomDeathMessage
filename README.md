# CustomDeathMessage

**CustomDeathMessage** is a simple Lethal Company mod that lets you replace the "[LIFE SUPPORT: OFFLINE]" death message with one of your own.

Rich text should work too if you'd like to include styles like color & italic.

**IN MY TESTING THERE IS A CHARACTER LIMIT OF ABOUT 22**. Exceeding this character limit will cause the death message to split into multiple lines.
